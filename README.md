# This is a repository for latex documents. So far, it ony contains a template for International Baccalaureate (IB) papers. 

## Goals:
The goal is to provide a simple to use latex template which will follow all of the formatting standards of the IB programme, this way students will only have to focus on the content of the paper, and not the style.
